			Hello! My name is Benjamin Alvi, and I am currently studying computer science at Oregon State University. 
			I've been working a multitude of personal projects over the years, many of which can be found on my github and
			gitlab pages. I'm planning to use this space to document future projects. I have always aspired to be a 
			game developer, and as such many of those projects have been small games. If you're interested in some of my
			thoughts on game development, please feel free to check out my blog. 
			<br></br>
			I have been programming since the seventh grade, and I quickly feel in love with it. I saw coding as a new
			medium for me to create games. Every since then, I have been creating small video games. This has led me to
			persue a career in game development. I have learns languages and frameworks from python to C# and Unity to 
			Godot in persuit of this goal.
			<br></br>
			Outside of programming, I have been writing short stories in my spare time. I also enjoy going on hikes,
			cooking, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.

			<div class="proj-title">Infinity Scheduler</div>		
			Status: WIP, Realse Date: May 26
			<br></br>
			<a href="https://infinityscheduler.com">Link</a>
			<br></br>
			A webapp scheduler with an integrated AI, as well as several other convience features. Currently in beta.
			Built as a part of my univeristy senior capstone project along with Kennedy Vandal, Youli Zhao, and Zhifeng Li.
			<br></br>
			
			This project was built for an external client. You can find more information about them
			<a href="https://www.remarkablearts.biz/">here</a>.
			<br></br>
			Some of these convience features would have included: cross-app integration, goal planning, cross-schedule scheduling, and automatic event completion tracking, and more.
			My team and I mostly wrote the foundational code for this project and didn't have the time to expand it to encompass all the planned features.
			<br></br>
			I acted as the lead developer for this project, and was in charge of delegating tasks.
			<br></br>
			At the end of this project, it will be handed off to another group of developers.

			Status: WIP

			<a>Link (Not released)</a>
			<br></br>
			Bullet hell shoot 'em up, currently in early development. Spiritual successor to Bullet Engine.
			Built in Godot

			<div class="proj"> 
			<div class="proj-title">Production Panic</div>
		
			Status: WIP, Development Halted
			<br></br>
			<a href="https://quarkspring.itch.io/production-panic">Link</a>
			<br></br>
			Submission for GMTK Game Jam 2020. The theme for the jam was 'out of control'. The best
			way to describe this game would be a management sim where you play as a robot that has
			to manage repairing broken machinary and loading packages into a truck on an assembly line. 
			The game grows increasingly more chaotic as time progresses. Built in Godot. Development was halted after
			the game jam ended. I may come back to this project later.

			<div class="proj"> 
			<div class="proj-title">Bullet Engine</div>
			
			Status: Released v1.0.0
			<br></br>
			<a href="https://github.com/BenBlueAlvi/BulletEngine">Link</a>
			<br></br>
			Summer personal project. It's a bullet hell shoot 'em up with 6 stages. At the end of each stage
			is a shop where the player can purchase upgrades with the score that they accrue in the stages.
			There are a few other machanics like super bosses that spawn if a boss is killed without the 
			player taking damage. Built in LibGDX and Java. I may update this project to v1.1.0 eventually.
